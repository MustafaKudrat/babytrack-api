# BabyTrack Frontend

This is a React + Vite app with Tailwind CSS providing a simple mobile-friendly UI for the BabyTrack API.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust `VITE_API_BASE_URL` if needed.

Register a new account in the app to obtain a token. The token is stored in
`localStorage` so you stay logged in across reloads during development.

This app is also configured as a PWA so it can be installed on your phone.
